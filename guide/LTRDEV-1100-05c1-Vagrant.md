## Vagrant Up for Network Engineers

### Introducing Vagrant Up for Network Engineers

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is an Open Source tool for creating workflows to build and manage virtual 
machine environments.  Vagrant is developed and maintained by the San Francisco-based company
[HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/).  Vagrant is not just for software developers.  Developers, designers, DevOps 
engineers, and network engineers alike can use Vagrant to automatically provision consistent and disposable virtual 
environments that can be leveraged for application or scripting design, development, and testing.

You can use Vagrant to learn and test APIs, write and test scripts, and validate network device platform commands 
and configuration if the system you are interested can be virtualized.  Fortunately, many Cisco devices 
have been virtualized: IOS XE using the CSR 1000v image, NX-OS using the Nexus 9000v image, and IOS XR using the 
XRv image, to name a few.  Earn some developer street cred by learning how to "Vagrant Up"!
