### Exercise 1: Creating a GitHub Account

#### Objectives

The objectives for this exercise are to:

* Create a GitHub account
* Explore GitHub

#### Step 1: Creating a GitHub Account

Although creating a GitHub account is not required to clone Git repositories hosted on GitHub, why not join and 
participate in one of the largest developer communities on the Internet?  Doing so gives you the opportunity to see 
what other people are working on or are interested in, learn how software is built by following projects, and share 
your work - no matter how small - with the community.  Cisco product teams, Cisco DevNet, and Cisco SEs all share and
collaborate through GitHub.

1. Open a web browser and navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/): `https://github.com/`.
2. On the GitHub homepage, fill out the form to [Sign up](https://github.com/join?source=header-home), choosing a 
unique username, entering your email address, and creating a password.  Click the `Sign up for GitHub` button.
3. Choose the personal plan `Unlimited public repositories for free.`  Optionally click to select `Send me updates on
GitHub news, offers, and events`.  Click the `Continue` button.
4. Tailor your GitHub experience by answering the questions.  Click the `Submit` button.

Congratulations, you have joined the GitHub community!

#### Step 2: Exploring GitHub

1. Take a few minutes to follow new and interesting people.
    
    Search for and follow your Cisco Live lab proctors:
    
    * [Curtis Smith](https://github.com/curtissmith) (`curtissmith`)
    * [Matthew Galazka](https://github.com/mgalazka) (`mgalazka`)
    
    Share your GitHub username in this lab's Cisco Webex Teams space.  Search for and follow your fellow Cisco Live lab 
    participants.

2. Take a few minutes to discover new repositories:.
    
    Search for and star the Cisco Live [LTRPRG-1100 session](https://github.com/curtissmith/LTRPRG-1100) repository.
    
    Search for and bookmark the [Cisco DevNet](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet) organization where sample code from 
    Cisco DevNet is shared.
    
    Search for and bookmark the [Cisco Systems Engineers](https://github.com/CiscoSE) organization where sample 
    code from Cisco SE community is shared.
