## Cisco Webex Teams

### Introducing Cisco Webex Teams

[Cisco Webex Teams](https://www.webex.com/products/teams/index.html) (formerly Cisco Spark) is a platform for 
teamwork, communication, and collaboration. It allows individuals and teams to communicate via messaging, video 
meetings, whiteboarding, and more. On the surface, it has a lot of use and functionality; though with its 
well-developed API, it can become a favorite tool of the Network Programmability Ninja.

Through robust API, Webex Teams can act as a bidirectional human interfacing tool with network programmability.
Webex teams supports the concept of Integrations and Bots, providing a platform and framework for new and interesting 
applications and use cases outside of traditional Unified Communications applications.  Webex Teams could be a platform 
for network devices to communicate alerts, status changes, or other information. It could also provide a way for a 
network operator to query a network device for interface statistics using human language. This level of 
extensibility brings much to the table for the Network Programmability Ninja.
