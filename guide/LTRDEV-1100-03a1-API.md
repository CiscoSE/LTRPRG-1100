## Application Programming Interface (API)

### Introducing APIs

As discussed earlier in the introduction to Postman, APIs are a structured method of communicating with software. 
Information be queried (similar to a CLI `show` command on a network device) or changed (think of `config t` on a 
network device CLI) in a programmatic way. Not only can commands be run through a script, but the information returned 
from an API is often structured in a way that allows for easy parsing or manipulation of data. This allows for someone
to code in logical steps to be taken depending on the returned values. In other words, APIs are the key to allowing
code to interact with software, devices, and other external components, amplifying the possibilities of what can be 
accomplished.
